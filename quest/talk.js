
Mr. Wright

{first}
We have a problem, punk. Wright's jungest son is dead. We don't know why, 
and most importantly - who. Find the bastard and you'll get Wrights respect.

    {have seen Billy}
    [Billy might know.] ->  I've spoken to Billy, he is telling a story might related.

    OR

    {have seen Billy and IN > 6}
    [I have som threads ...] I might be able to help soon.

    [Don't wand to bother.] Whith all respect, I dont' want to take this task.

Well then why should I spend my time on you? You have one minute to explain.

    [I've reconsidered] On a second thought, I've reconsidered. I'll see what i can find.

    END <- [Bye] END Goodbye mr. Wright.
