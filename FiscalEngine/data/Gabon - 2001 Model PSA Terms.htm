<h3><font color="#004080">BONUS &amp; OTHER PAYMENTS</font></h3>

<p>Article 28.1 of the <i>2001 Model Contract</i> provides for the payment of a 
signature bonus. The amount of the signature bonus is negotiable but 
amounts up to US$3 million are indicative in contracts signed to date and this 
amount has been assumed here. There is no provision in the <i>2001 Model 
Contract</i> for the payment of a discovery bonus and none has been assumed here.</p>

<p>Article 28.2 of the <i>2001 Model Contract</i> provides for the payment of 
production bonuses upon start of commercial production and at two unspecified 
daily production thresholds. The amounts of the production bonuses are 
negotiable and can vary a great deal with payments at any of the thresholds 
reaching several million US dollars. The following production thresholds and 
bonuses have been assumed here:</p>

<p>Bonuses relate to the entire contract area and are non-recoverable costs.</p>

<p>Article 21.7 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that the contractor 
must make annual contributions to the Hydrocarbons Support Fund (Fonds de 
Soutien des Hydrocarbures) created to develop petroleum research activities in 
Gabon. Under the <i>2001 Model Contract, </i>two payments are due: </p>

<ul>
  <li>a negotiable annual contribution in US dollars during  exploration and 
  production periods, which contribution is cost recoverable (annual 
  contributions of US$50,000 during exploration period and US$100,000 during 
  production period have been assumed here); and </li>
  <li>US$0.05 per barrel of 
  available production (gross production in the contract area less losses and 
  use in operations) during each year of the production period, which 
  contribution is <b>not</b> cost recoverable.</li>

  </li>
</ol>

<p>Article 39.1 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides for the payment of 
a negotiable annual training fee. The <i>2001 Model Contract </i>requires one rate to be fixed 
for the exploration period and another for the development and production 
periods. The amounts agreed in contracts signed 
to date vary - indicative amounts are US$50,000 rising to  US$200,000 per year depending on the phase of the development.&nbsp;We have
assumed  US$50,000 per year during exploration phase and  US$150,000 per year during the
production phase.&nbsp;Article 39.2 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides 
that the training fees are recoverable costs.</p>

<h3><font color="#004080">STATE PARTICIPATION</font></h3>

<p>Under a production sharing contract the state may assume a participating 
interest in the contract at a level agreed at the time of award and exercisable 
at the time of commercial development. The level of the state's participation 
interest is negotiable but in practice the rate has varied between 5% and 25%, 
with an overall decreasing trend over the past 20 years or so (5% has been 
assumed here). The state's participating interest is carried through to 
production start-up. Carried development costs are reimbursed, with interest 
(assumed to be 8%), from 100% of state's share of revenue.&nbsp;Carried exploration costs are
not reimbursed. <i>(2001 MC Art 19.3)</i></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>Notes:</i></p>

<ol style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0">
  <li>
<p style="word-spacing: 1; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The 2001 Model 
Contract limits annual reimbursement to 70% of the state's share of revenue. 
However, this provision appears to be <i>negotiable.</i></p>

  </li>
  <li>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i>The 1998 Model Contract set an upper limit of 10% and the 1993 
Model Contract of 25% for state participation. The 1998 Model Contract also 
reserved an additional 5% for Gabonese private investors. If the Gabonese 
investors did not take up this option, it was made available to the state.</i></p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h3><font color="#004080">ROYALTY</font></h3>

<p>Article 26.1 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that royalty shall be 
levied on gross production less any volumes lost, used in operations, or 
re-injected into the reservoir. The <i>2001 Model Contract </i>stipulates 
the payment of royalty at an unspecified fixed flat rate (5% has been assumed here).</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0"><i>Notes:</i></p>

<ol style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0">
  <li><i>Royalty rates have always been a negotiable item and, as a 
result, have varied considerably. Even in the 1980s when most contracts 
included flat-rate royalties, these could vary between 5% and 20% from contract 
to contract. The 1993 Model Contract specified a flat rate royalty of 20% 
for crude oil and 16% for gas. Later, during the 1990s, sliding scale 
rates were adopted in most contracts with the 1998 Model Contract providing for 
royalty to be payable at variable rates linked to a sliding scale of production.</i></li>
  <li><i>In launching the eighth round for &quot;ultra-deep&quot; water areas in 1997, the 
  government announced that it would agree to royalty rates lower than those 
  agreed to previously and this has been borne out in deep water awards to date.</i></li>
</ol>

<h3><font color="#004080">COST RECOVERY</font></h3>

<p>Article 24.2 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that recoverable costs are expensed and recovered immediately from gross revenue less
royalty subject to a negotiable ceiling. The negotiable
ceiling is indicatively in the range 75% to 80% (80% has been assumed here) of gross revenue less
royalty.&nbsp;Un-recovered costs may be carried forward indefinitely until fully recovered 
but not beyond the duration of the contract.</p>

<p><i>Note: In the 1998 Model Contract, a ceiling of 55% of net production 
was specified, which could be increased to 75% if, after the first five years of 
production, the contractor had yet to recover all of its &quot;investment in 
development&quot;. In practice, the cost recovery ceiling is one of the key negotiable terms of the 
contract and a variety of arrangements have been agreed in the past. Indeed, the 
government emphasised in 1997 that for &quot;ultra-deep&quot; water blocks offered in the 
eighth round the ceiling would be adjusted to speed up cost recovery and this 
appears to be borne out by recent awards. Some contracts are understood to 
have featured various ceilings related to the water depth in which a field is 
located and at least one contract makes provision for an uplift of recoverable 
costs (i.e. more than 100% of actual costs incurred).</i></p>

<h3><font color="#004080">PROFIT SHARING</font></h3>

<p>Article 25 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that production 
remaining after royalty and cost recovery is shared between the contractor and 
the state at negotiable rates linked to an incremental sliding scale of average 
daily production levels. The <i>2001 Model Contract </i>indicates four 
production tranches with both the tranche levels and profit shares left open for 
negotiation. The state's share of production includes a portion equivalent to 
the amount of corporation tax which the contractor would otherwise be liable to 
pay. The following profit shares have been assumed here:</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic"><font size="3">Note: In 
practice, profit sharing is one of the key negotiable terms of the contract and 
a variety of arrangements have been agreed in the past. Sliding scales are 
usually used with the number of tranches ranging from two to six. The government 
has mentioned the possibility of linking profit shares to measures of 
profitability instead of production, although this approach does not appear to 
have been adopted in actual contracts.</font></span></h3>

<h3><font color="#004080">INCOME TAX</font></h3>

<p>Article 26 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that the contractor is 
subject to corporation tax on income, payment of which is made in kind by 
delivery to the state of a quantity of petroleum corresponding to the amount of 
said tax. The state's share of production under the profit sharing provisions 
includes the part representing the income tax due by the contractor. Thus, the 
contractor's income tax liability is discharged by the state on its behalf.</p>

<p><em>Note: The tax rate applicable to remaining concession contracts is
73% while the generally applicable income tax rate is 35%. </em></p>

<h3><font color="#004080">DOMESTIC SUPPLY OBLIGATION</font></h3>

<p>Article 35 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that investors may be 
required to supply local refineries with a proportion of production (equal to the
contract production as a proportion of total Gabonese production) at a discounted price. 
In practice, the discount may be negotiable typically ranging 10% - 20%.</p>

<p>The discount is a recoverable cost. <em style="font-style: normal">This 
provision effectively has a zero net impact on the contractor's cash flow.&nbsp;The 
contractor is obliged to sell a proportion of its cost oil and profit oil at a 
discount but the value of the discount is recoverable. Thus, apart from the lag 
of recovering the discount (one year), the contractor does not lose any value. 
As a result, this obligation has not been modelled.</em></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><em>Note: </em><i>The 1998 model 
contract specified a discount of 25%.</i></p>

<h3><font color="#004080">DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX</font></h3>

<p>Article 26.7 of the <i>2001 Model Contract </i>provides that the companies 
comprising the contractor are exempt from any tax and withholding at source on 
the distribution of profits from operations under a PSC.</p>

<p><i>Note: Generally, dividends paid are subject to a 20% withholding tax.</i></p>

<h3><font color="#004080"><i>Quality</i></font></h3>

<p><em>Gabonese authorities issue model PSCs from time to time. The most recent 
model contract was issued in 2001, replacing an earlier 1998 version issued in 
conjunction with the eighth round. The 2001 model contract is understood to form 
the foundation of negotiations for all new awards and its provisions are used as 
a basis of this model. All terms are negotiable. Royalty rates are IHS 
assumption based on higher rates from the sliding scale used in 1998 Model 
Contract; bonuses, annual contributions, cost recovery ceiling, and profit 
sharing rates and trigger points assumed in this model are indicative of 
contracts signed for oil in ultra deep water areas (&gt; 1,000m water depth) in 
late 1990s - early 2000s.</em></p>

<p><i>Article 30 of the 2001 Model Contract provides that in the event of a 
commercial gas discovery the state guarantees to grant to the contractor fiscal 
terms which are at least as favourable as terms granted to other oil companies 
operating in Gabon with all other provisions of the contract applying mutatis 
mutandis. For the purposes of calculation of bonuses, cost recovery, and profit 
sharing, gas equivalents are to be calculated using 165 m<sup>3</sup> of gas = 1 
barrel of oil. In the current model we have assumed </i><em>gas calculated on an 
equivalence basis using 6,000 cubic feet of gas = 1 barrel of oil.</em></p>
